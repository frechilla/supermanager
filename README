This repository is meant to contain random code to parse data off 
supermanager.acb.com and do some calculations on it.

Currently there are 2 different things going on here:
    + rankings: It is supposeed to contain the received stats (ranking) per 
        team and per position (Similar to what can be found @
            http://www.rincondelmanager.com/smgr/valoracion_rec.php)
    + Backtracking algorithm to calculate the best team of each round (and
        also what teams can get to a certain amount of points)
